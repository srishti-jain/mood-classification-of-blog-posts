# Mood Classification of Blog posts

### Purpose of the Project

Sentiment analysis or mood analysis of a given text lets us classify it according to the different emotions that they were written. It lets us gauge the actual intent behind the text of the author. 

There are several challenges with achieving this due to the nature of Blog posts - there&#39;s a large variation in writing styles of different authors and the dynamic nature of the author&#39;s mood with larger posts and time spans.

In this project, we sought to emulate previous work in this field and implement it. We sought to refer other works and observe how traditional methods have been improved by various techniques and hence to come up with a refined method of classifying the text on the basis of the mood of the text.

### Technical Specifications
We tried to achieve this task on a dataset of a set of blog posts obtained from *LiveJournal*. *LiveJournal* is an online diary entry website which provides various moods in a drop box list. 

We used features like frequency counts, lengths, sentiment orientations, emphasized words, special symbols and pointwise mutual information (PMI) for the machine learning experiments.

On using these features, we&#39;ll annotate the blog data with mood labels, and implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

### Application areas of project

Sentiment analysis has various important applications â€“ in Business Intelligence (to better understand product feedback and customer experience), politics (in approval ratings), law/policy making (public opinion on draft laws), psychology and sociology.
